This project simulates a high-stakes cricket match where users participate in a digital toss, choose their play style (Batting or Bowling), and compete against a randomized AI opponent. The game logic adheres to traditional "Hand Cricket" rules: if the player and CPU pick the same number, a wicket falls; otherwise, the runs are added to the total.
